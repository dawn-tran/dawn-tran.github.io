Based on the requirements and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `App.vue`: The main Vue component that serves as the entry point of the application. It will contain the main layout and navigation logic.

2. `Navbar.vue`: A reusable component that represents the navigation bar at the top of the website. It will display the main navigation links and handle the active state.

3. `HomePage.vue`: A component that represents the landing page of the website. It will display the Course section with the available courses.

4. `CoursePage.vue`: A component that represents an individual course page. It will display the course information, syllabus, units, links, and FAQ.

5. `UnitPage.vue`: A component that represents a specific unit within a course. It will display the content of the unit, which will be fetched from the Schoology API.

6. `BioPage.vue`: A component that represents the Bio page. It will display the personal information of the teacher.

7. `ContactPage.vue`: A component that represents the Contact page. It will provide a form for users to contact the teacher.

8. `Chatbox.vue`: A component that represents the chatbox. It will handle user interactions and communicate with OpenAI's API to provide answers to questions.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
